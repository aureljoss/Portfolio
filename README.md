## Tell Me a Little Bit About Yourself ðŸ˜Ž

Over the past ten years, I've built products for companies and businesses around the globe with a focus on design, usability, accessibility and inclusivity.

While the products I design have been in the built environment, the skills I have learned as an architect and designer are all applicable to the digital world. From working with multi-disciplinary teams, to iterating through design concepts and working with stakeholders, I am committed to meeting client expectations while creating great user experiences.

I have now been learning front-end development for more than a year with an emphasis on emplimenting modern best practices. I am currently learning React and Redux to further develop my ability to create dynamic web pages. 

I recommend looking through the pinned repositories showcasing my skills and latest projects.

In my downtime, you can find me eating tacos, biking or at the dog park. ðŸ˜‰
